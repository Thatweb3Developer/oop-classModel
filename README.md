# Animal Kingdom Simulation

This README provides a brief overview of the program and instructions on how to use it. Beginners can follow the steps outlined in the README to understand, use, and modify the code.


This simple JavaScript program simulates the Animal Kingdom using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Classes

### Animal
- Represents generic animal properties and behaviors.
- Methods:
  - `makeSound()`: Placeholder for making a sound.
  - `eat()`: Placeholder for eating behavior.

### Mammal
- Represents mammals, inheriting from Animal.
- Methods:
  - `giveBirth()`: Placeholder for giving birth behavior.

### Bird
- Represents birds, inheriting from Animal.
- Methods:
  - `fly()`: Placeholder for flying behavior.

## Usage

1. Create instances of animals:
   ```javascript
   const lion = new Mammal("Lion");
   const sparrow = new Bird("Sparrow");
        lion.makeSound();
        sparrow.fly();

        lion.eat();
        sparrow.eat();
        lion.giveBirth(); // Mammals can give birth
        sparrow.fly();    // Birds can fly
